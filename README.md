# Align Layers
Added keyboard shortcuts to the "Align layers" functions in
Sketch.

I made a YouTube video that explains its usefulness and such...

- Use `^ ⌘ ←` to align layers by their left edges
- Use `^ ⌘ →` to align layers by their right edges
- Use `^ ⌘ ↑` to align layers by their top edges
- Use `^ ⌘ ↓` to align layers by their bottom edges
- Use `^ ⌘ .` to align layers by their vertical centers
- Use `^ ⌘ /` to align layers by their horizontal centers

2. Double-click the `.sketchplugin` file

## To Infinity and Beyond...
Once I learn more about creating Sketch Plugins, I'll update this plugin to include even more useful quick keys...
